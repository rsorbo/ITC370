<h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Rob Sorbo</h2>
        <p>
                I am a Customer Success Manager at Ion Wave Technologies, a web-based SaaS used by <br>
            many government agencies for their procurement. In my role as Customer Success Manager, <br>
            I provide support and training to my customers, as well as implementing new customers. <br>
            I love the teaching aspect of my job! At the encouragement of my boss, I have begun <br>
            training to become a developer.         
        </p>
        <p>
                Since the SaaS I work for is web-based, it will be important for me to learn aspects <br>
            of web design. However, the primary tools I'll use are more back-end, such as C#, SQL, <br>
            and .Net. I have already taken a C# course, and I really enjoyed it. I have worked with <br>
            many databases in the past, so I have some knowledge of SQL as well.
        </p>
